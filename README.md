and DaisyUI for the components.

## Summary and Learning Points

Throughout all of the programs I've written so far, I have tried to save look/layouts for last, and never really
got to it, but on this portfolio I spent a significant amount of my time on formatting, and making the page look nice.
It was definitely a different kind of challenge which I enjoyed
